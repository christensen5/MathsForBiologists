    "1. **Island Model** Assume that a species lives in a habitat that consists of many islands close to a mainland. The species occupies both the mainland and the islands, but, although it is present on the mainland at all times, it frequently goes extinct on the islands. Islands can be recolonized by migrants from the mainland. The following model keeps track of the fraction of islands occupied: Denote the fraction of islands occupied at time $t$ by $p(t)$. Assume that each island experiences a constant risk of extinction and that vacant islands (the fraction $1-p$) are colonized from the mainland at a constant rate. Then\n",

Walker and Valentine (1984) suggested a model for species diversity which assumes that species extinction rates are independent of diversity but speciation rates are regulated by competition. Denoting the number of species at time $t$ by $S(t)$, the speciation rate by $b$, and the extinction rate by $a$, they used the model\n",
