Each individual of species 1 consumes 3 units of food $A$ and 5 units of food $B$, each individual of species 2 consumes 2 units of food $A$ and 3 units of food $B$, and individual of species 3 consumes 1 unit of food $A$ and 2 units of food $B$. Each day, 500 units of food $A$ and 900 units of food $B$ are supplied. How many individuals of each species can be reared together? Is there more than one solution? What happens if we add 550 units of a third type of food, called $C$, and each individual of species 1 consumes 2 units of food $C$, each individual of species 2 consumes 4 units of food $C$, and each individual of species 3 consumes 1 unit of food $C$?\n",

    "3. Networks are abstractions of real systems used to identify and study patterns of connectivity between the individual units that compose those systems. Networks (often referred to as *graphs*) are mathematically defined as a set of *nodes*, or vertices, (representing the individual units) and a set of *links*, or connections, between these nodes, which account for the interaction patterns within the studied systems. In Ecology, graphs have been widely used in studies investigating food-webs, plant-pollinator interactions, and disease transmission in populations.  \n",
