    "### Simple equation for predator prey motion\n",
    "\n",
    "Oscillations are found throughout many diverse phenomena in ecology and evolution. Predator-prey dynamics are amongst the most well-known as shown in Fig. 1a with data on populations of hares and lynxes. Simple versions of these dynamics are represented by the Lotka-Volterra model Fig. 1b, which produce oscillating solutions for hares and lynxes Fig. 1c. A powerful idea is that the motion of predator-prey (and many other similar systems) can be represented as different projections of motion on a circle as shown in Fig. 1d. Why we would want to do this is explored in this tutorial and how using the concept of complex numbers is the most natural and compact way to describe circular motion.\n",

    "The plot of $X$ vs $Y$ is called a *phase plane* and shows the behaviour is very well-represented by simple sinusoidal behaviour for prey $X$ and predator $Y$, about some average value $X^*$ and $Y^*$ for predator and prey respectively:\n",

    "where $\\omega = 2\\pi/T$ is the *angular velocity* of the oscillations, where $T$ is the period. If we assume the predator natural rate of death is the same as rate of growth of prey and that the predator is $100\\%$ efficient in gaining energy for growth from death of prey due to predation, then it turns out $R_1=R_2$; if we let $x(t)=X(t)-X^*$ and $y(t)=Y(t)-Y^*$, be the number of excess prey and predators, then our equation of motion is\n",

    "   **a)** With reference to Fig. 1d, verify that for each of the times $t=0,1,2,3,…8$ years the values of $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ match their corresponding values on the $x-y$ plane and that as time progresses the motion is along the circumference of the circle. Which direction is the motion on the circle: clockwise or anti-clockwise? What is the relationship of $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ with respect to the motion on the circle?\n",

    "Imagine a worm placed in a 2D maze. They are intelligent worms that happen to understand just two mathematical instructions for each move at a time:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. crawl a distance $x$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. then rotate $90^\\circ$ or $\\pi/2$ radians (anti-clockwise) and then crawl a distance $y$\n",
    "\n",
    "in other words they move like the Knight chess piece, except with arbitrary lengths $x$ and $y$ of the ``capital L''.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** Starting at the red square and ending at the green square, your task is to write down the list of instructions for each step in turn, which will navigate the worm through this maze, where for each step you specify $x+iy$  where $i$ indicates ``rotate by $90^\\circ$''. For a given path you want to specify the minimal number of steps. \\\\\n",
    "      (N.B. assume the worm only moves in whole squares ($x$ and $y$ are integers) and that they can move left/right and up/down(i.e. $x$ and $y$ can take negative values).\n",

    "1. rotate an angle $\\theta$ (relative to the $x$-axis or horizontal)\n",
    "2. jump a distance $r$ in that direction\n",

    "## Multiplication & rotation using complex numbers\n",

    "The previous question has introduced the idea that one way to describe points in a plane, is to use a new type of number called *complex numbers* (a better name might be 2D numbers for 2 dimensional), where $i$ represents a rotation by $90^\\circ$ ($\\pi/2$ radians) -- by convention anti-clockwise.\n",
